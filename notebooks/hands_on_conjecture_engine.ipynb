    "We'll build a tiny end-to-end *research-style* workflow based on conjecture generation and, in doing so, cover the main components needed to get started with integrating LLMs into your research via the OpenAI API. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calling a Model** (chat completions API)\n",
    "2. **Prompting Strategies and Templates** (prompt engineering, f-strings, `jinja` templates)\n",
    "3. **Structured Outputs** (getting an LLM to return output as parsable `JSON` and load into a python `dataclass`)\n",
    "4. **Tool Calling**\n",
    "5. **Simple Agent Loops** (generate → check → refine loop)\n",
